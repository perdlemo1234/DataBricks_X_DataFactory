# DataBricks_X_DataFactory ( mainly Databricks ) 

## _Overview / Context:_
This is a documentation of my journey implementing a medallion architecture where it can logically and neatly arranges data within a data lakehouse. At the time of writing the documentation, I've completed the implementation within DataBricks. However, Hans' student credit has expired and currently has no access to Databricks to run any sort of code. Luckily, all python code and markdown text are saved within Hans' computer. Technically, implementing a medallion structure within ADF is possible _(through the use of Azure Functions)_ but is less flexible compared to Databricks. Also, databricks are scalable too , making it easier when there's a slight change within the pipeline.
